# Clean-Player
# Description:
Ever feel like Apple sometimes clutters the UI?

Well Clean Player helps remove/hide some of it. We hope y'all enjoy! 
Options in Prefs:

* Remove time stamps from current playing song.
* Hide airplay icon on the lockscreen player.
* Hide the duration slider.
* Change the background color of the player.
P.S. Admire simplicity
